# Image-Texture-Classification-of-Pituitary-Tumors-via-CycleGAN
* Tumor detection has always been one of the key subjects in medical imaging research, and pituitary tumor is a benign tumor commonly seen in clinical cases at present. It usually occurs in the young and middle-aged period, and has a great impact on the fertility function of patients as well as their ability to study and work. However, preoperative evaluation of the soft and hard texture of pituitary tumor has a direct impact on the selection of surgical options. Therefore, the improvement of preoperative evaluation accuracy has extremely important guiding significance for the medical effect.	This paper focuses on the pathological grading of multi-mode medical images based on spatial sequence, takes the MRI spatial sequence images of pituitary tumor as the research object, conducts an in-depth study on the neural network model needed in the grading, and elaborates on the advantages of multi-mode medical image grading compared with single-mode medical image grading. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of under-sampling of images in T1 domain and T2 domain in the existing data set, the deep learning model and algorithm based on CycleGAN are studied and implemented.
* It is a semi-supervised method for image texture classification of pituitary tumors via CycleGAN and optimized feature extraction
